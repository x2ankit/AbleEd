I've fixed the formatting issues in your README.md file by:
- Adding proper line breaks between sections
- Fixing the code block formatting with proper triple backticks
- Ensuring consistent spacing throughout
- Making the section headers more clearly separated
- Improving the overall readability while maintaining all your original content

The structure is now cleaner and follows standard Markdown conventions for GitHub README files.
